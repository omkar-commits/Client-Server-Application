# Client-Server-Application
client/server application for temperature sensing. The temperature sensor used in this application is the built in CPU temperature my raspberry pi. The path to read the CPU temperature by embedded SBC is (/ sys /class /thermal/ thermal_zone0/temp) by embedded SBC. The data of temperature is measured and displayed in the form of graph. Once the temperature is sensed the client device connects to server and pass the data to store. The stored temperature can be checked in the history of data, at the max 20 inputs from the client can be viewed in history of temperature data. Initially this process was tested using single client.   The application is designed to handle multiple clients in threaded format. The server should be able to process and handle multiple clients. Along with temperature current date and time data is also shared by the client to server.
